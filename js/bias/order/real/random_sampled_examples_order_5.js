Freedom of speech: In many countries, advertising is protected under the principle of freedom of speech. This means that as long as the content of the ads is not defamatory, discriminatory, or incites violence, it is generally considered legal.\n\n2. Regulatory compliance: Mobile game ads are subject to regulatory guidelines imposed by advertising regulators in various countries. As long as the ads comply with these regulations, they are considered legal. These guidelines often specify requirements regarding truthfulness, clarity, and disclosure of any potential risks or in-app purchases.\n\n3. Consent-based advertising",
