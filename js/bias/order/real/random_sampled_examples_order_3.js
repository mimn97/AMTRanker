        "System A": " English languages that add an 'R' to words that end with an 'A' are called \"r-colored\" languages. This is because the 'R' sound is typically added to the end of words that end with an 'A' in order to make the vowel sound clearer and more distinct. This is especially common in languages that have a strong emphasis on vowel sounds, such as German and Dutch.",
        "System B": " Some English languages have a tendency to adding the letter \"R\" to words when they end in \"a\", as a result of history and cultural influences. This phenomenon is known as \"Adding-An-r\" or simply \"Ar-Rule\". It has its origins in Old French, which had a similar rule regarding the addition of suffixes ending on -ar or -er. The rule was later added to other languages such as German, Scottish Gaelic, and Welsh through different means.\n\nThe main idea behind this rule can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.   Words",

This phenomenon is mainly found in certain English varieties, such as American English, some Scottish accents, and some dialects in Ireland, Canada, and the United States.\nThe historical reason for the addition of an 'R' can be traced back to the development of the English language.

Some English languages, such as American English and Irish English, are rhotic, meaning they pronounce the 'R' sound in words like 'car' and'star'. Other English languages, such as Scottish English and Australian English, are non-rhotic, meaning they do not pronounce the 'R' sound in these words.

In words that end in 'a', when followed by a word that begins with a vowel, an intrusive 'r' sound is added to make it easier to pronounce in such accents.
