        "reference": "You'll normally only hear this in non-rhotic (non-'R'-pronouncing) accents when one word ends with a vowel sound, and the next one *starts* with a vowel sound.\n\nNon-rohtic accents have what's called a [Linking R](_URL_0_), where words that end with an R won't have the R pronounced when the word is said in isolation, but *will* have the R pronounced when the following word starts with a vowel sound.\n\nThe phenomenon you're seeing is an over-extension of the above rule, called an [Intrusive R](_URL_1_), where the rule for linking Rs is over applied, and pronounced between *any* two words where the first ends in a (specific kind of) vowel sound, and the second begins with a vowel sound.",

        "System A": " In English, when a word ends in a single 'a', it is usually pronounced as \"uh\". However, when an 'R' is added to the end of the word, it changes the pronunciation to \"er\". This is called a rhotic sound.\nThe addition of the 'R' is often done to differentiate between two words that sound similar but have different meanings. For example, the word \"barr\" means a type of fruit, while the word \"bar\" means a counter or a place to eat. By adding the 'R', the two words sound different and are easier to distinguish.\n\nThe",

        "reference": "I can explain my personal experience with this.  Energy!  When my old bands and I used to record, our drummers were timing with a metronome to keep a steady beat with each track.  When we used to play live we would occasionally play faster.  Most of us would not notice it, but people would mention it to us later.  The drummer would get excited and start playing harder and faster.",

        "System A": "There are a few reasons why many bands choose to play their songs with a faster beat when performing live compared to the recorded version:\n1. Energy and excitement: Playing songs with a faster beat can create a sense of energy and excitement in a live performance. It helps to build up the atmosphere and engage the audience, making the performance more dynamic and captivating.\n\n2. Crowd interaction: A faster beat can encourage crowd participation, such as clapping or dancing along. It creates a more interactive and engaging experience for the audience, making them feel more involved in the performance.\n\n3. Live improvisation: Playing live allows musicians to add their own personal",
        "System B": " The tempo of a song can be affected by many different factors, including the mood of the band, the mood of the crowd, the acoustics of the venue, and even the time of day. When a band plays a song live, they want to connect with the crowd. They want to make the crowd feel the same emotions that they felt when they wrote the song. To do this, the band will often speed up the tempo of the song to match the mood of the crowd.This is why it's important for bands to practice their songs live before they record them. They want to make sure that the tempo of the",
