        "reference": "There are many theories, but I am a diaper fetishist (which is fairly uncommon), and I have spent the better part of my life trying to figure out where in the hell it comes from. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was about five or six, and I remember just waking up one day and my mother was gone. No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children. Child pornography is a disgusting, despicable practice and the grand majority of people who share my interests feel the same way. \n\nedit 2: I should do an AMA...this is fun!

        "reference": "There are many theories, but I am a diaper fetishist (which is fairly uncommon), and I have spent the better part of my life trying to figure out where in the hell it comes from. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was about five or six, and I remember just waking up one day and my mother was gone. No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children. Child pornography is a disgusting, despicable practice and the grand majority of people who share my interests feel the same way. \n\nedit 2: I should do an AMA...this is fun!

If I'm  not mistaken, both Dresser Wayne and Gilbarco (two of the big manufacturers) make them, and have made them for a while. They have several notable drawbacks.\n\nAutomatic Cash Acceptors, ACAs, are both unreliable and inaccurate. Everyone has dealt with them in things like soda machines. They take bills without giving credit, give back incorrect change, and jam up regularly. All of these issues add overhead costs for the gas station and royally piss off customers.\n\nACA's require frequent cash refills and empties. ATM's are refilled by armed guards, which are very expensive and are usually billed by the minute for their time, armored truck time, and driver time. A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot. Customers paying cash at the pump reduces that profit.\n\nSo an ACA upsets customers, costs a lot of money, and creates a higher risk of theft and property damage.

They take bills without giving credit, give back incorrect change, and jam up regularly. All of these issues add overhead costs for the gas station and royally piss off customers.\n\nACA's require frequent cash refills and empties. ATM's are refilled by armed guards, which are very expensive and are usually billed by the minute for their time, armored truck time, and driver time. A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot. Customers paying cash at the pump reduces that profit.\n\nSo an ACA upsets customers, costs a lot of money, and creates a higher risk of theft and property damage. It's a lose:lose:lose kind of situation in most cases.",

        "System A": "Many modern gas pumps have a credit or debit card option instead of a cash option. This is because most gas stations do not want to keep large amounts of cash on hand. If a customer wants to pay with cash, the cash must be brought to the pump by the customer, which requires management of cash on the part of the gas station, as well as the risk that the cash will be stolen or lost.",
        "System B": " The gas pump companies don't want to deal with cash.  It's much easier for them to deal with a credit card.  They also don't want to be stuck with a bunch of cash if someone decides to rob the gas station.This is a good question.  The gas pump companies don\u2019t want to deal with cash.  It\u2019s much easier for them to deal with a credit card.  They also don\u2019t want to be stuck with a bunch of cash if someone decides to rob the gas station.\nI think this is a good question.

        "System A": "There are several reasons why ads for mobile games are not considered illegal:\n1. Freedom of speech: In many countries, advertising is protected under the principle of freedom of speech. This means that as long as the content of the ads is not defamatory, discriminatory, or incites violence, it is generally considered legal.\n\n2. Regulatory compliance: Mobile game ads are subject to regulatory guidelines imposed by advertising regulators in various countries. As long as the ads comply with these regulations, they are considered legal. These guidelines often specify requirements regarding truthfulness, clarity, and disclosure of any potential risks or in-app purchases.\n\n3. Consent-based advertising",
        "System B": " The ads for mobile games are not illegal because they are not deceptive or misleading. They are also not spammy or invasive. Instead, they are often well-targeted and well-designed, which makes them more likely to be clicked on and more likely to result in a sale.",
