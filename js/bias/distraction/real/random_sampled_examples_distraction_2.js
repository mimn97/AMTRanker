        "reference": "I'm no scientist, but this is eli5 and there is no response yet, so i'll wing it: water attenuates light. That is, the layer of water on your head doesn't reflect as much light as it would normally (dry), because not as much reflected light reaches your eye as it would when it's dry.\n\nEdit: It got me thinking, so i had to verify my own suspicion... I measured the reflectance of my own wet hair relative to it being dry. It's a little noisy as i spent maybe 30 seconds setting it up, and it's far from ideal, but I think this cooroborates what i postulate. ()[_URL_0_]",

        "System A": "Your hair goes darker when it's wet because the water molecules interfere with the reflection of light on your hair's surface. When your hair is wet, the water molecules are more likely to align themselves parallel to the surface of your hair, which causes the light to scatter in a way that makes your hair appear darker. This effect is known as the Tyndall effect. The clear water molecules do not interfere with the reflection of light on your hair's surface, which is why your hair appears lighter when dry.",
        "System B": "Your hair goes darker when it's wet because the melanin, a pigment that gives hair its color, is more easily absorbed by the hair when it's wet. When water is clear, the melanin is less likely to be absorbed and your hair will appear lighter.",
