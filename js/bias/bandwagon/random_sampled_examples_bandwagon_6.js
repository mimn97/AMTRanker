        "reference": "I used to manage a gas station, so hopefully I can answer a few of your questions. \n\nFirst off, cash acceptors in gas pumps exist. If I'm  not mistaken, both Dresser Wayne and Gilbarco (two of the big manufacturers) make them, and have made them for a while. They have several notable drawbacks.\n\nAutomatic Cash Acceptors, ACAs, are both unreliable and inaccurate. Everyone has dealt with them in things like soda machines. They take bills without giving credit, give back incorrect change, and jam up regularly. All of these issues add overhead costs for the gas station and royally piss off customers.\n\nACA's require frequent cash refills and empties. ATM's are refilled by armed guards, which are very expensive and are usually billed by the minute for their time, armored truck time, and driver time. A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot. Customers paying cash at the pump reduces that profit.\n\nSo an ACA upsets customers, costs a lot of money, and creates a higher risk of theft and property damage. It's a lose:lose:lose kind of situation in most cases.",

If I'm  not mistaken, both Dresser Wayne and Gilbarco (two of the big manufacturers) make them, and have made them for a while. They have several notable drawbacks.\n\nAutomatic Cash Acceptors, ACAs, are both unreliable and inaccurate. Everyone has dealt with them in things like soda machines. They take bills without giving credit, give back incorrect change, and jam up regularly. All of these issues add overhead costs for the gas station and royally piss off customers.\n\nACA's require frequent cash refills and empties. ATM's are refilled by armed guards, which are very expensive and are usually billed by the minute for their time, armored truck time, and driver time. A gas station full of ACAs would require daily service from a security company, which again adds overhead costs for the gas station.\n\nACA's are big targets for theft. A lone ATM is already a pretty high risk, and has many security features built in to deter theft. If you put 8-10 ACA's in a single gas station lot, you run a much higher risk of theft.\n\nACA's by their very nature lose the gas station money. Gas stations make almost all their profits from customers coming into the store and buying drinks and whatnot. Customers paying cash at the pump reduces that profit.\n\nSo an ACA upsets customers, costs a lot of money, and creates a higher risk of theft and property damage.

That is, the layer of water on your head doesn't reflect as much light as it would normally (dry), because not as much reflected light reaches your eye as it would when it's dry.\n\nEdit: It got me thinking, so i had to verify my own suspicion... I measured the reflectance of my own wet hair relative to it being dry. It's a little noisy as i spent maybe 30 seconds setting it up, and it's far from ideal, but I think this cooroborates what i postulate. ()[_URL_0_]",

        "System A": " The color of your hair is determined by the amount of melanin in your hair follicles.  When your hair is dry, melanin absorbs light, which makes your hair appear darker.  When your hair is wet, the melanin is suspended in water, which makes it less able to absorb light.  As a result, your hair appears lighter when it's wet.I am a software engineer and I love to solve problems. I am passionate about technology and I love learning new things.

        "System B": "Your hair goes darker when it's wet because the water molecules interfere with the reflection of light on your hair's surface. When your hair is wet, the water molecules are more likely to align themselves parallel to the surface of your hair, which causes the light to scatter in a way that makes your hair appear darker. This effect is known as the Tyndall effect. The clear water molecules do not interfere with the reflection of light on your hair's surface, which is why your hair appears lighter when dry.",
