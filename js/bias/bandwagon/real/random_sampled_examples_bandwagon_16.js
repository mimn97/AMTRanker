        "System A": "Sexual fetishisms can start in a variety of ways, and the exact cause is not fully understood. However, there are a few theories that seek to explain their origin.\nOne common theory is that fetishisms develop during early childhood or adolescence. Some psychologists believe that certain objects, body parts, or situations may become associated with sexual pleasure or arousal through a process known as classical conditioning. This occurs when a person repeatedly experiences sexual pleasure in conjunction with a specific stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus that can elicit sexual arousal on its own.\n\nFor example, if a person associates high heels with sexual pleasure because they were exposed to it during",
        "System B": "Sexual fetishisms can start due to a variety of factors. It is important to note that the topic is still widely researched and there isn't a definitive answer to this question. There are a few theories that psychologists and sexologists propose:\n1. Classical Conditioning: This theory suggests that the fetish develops through association. For example, if an object or situation was present during a person's first sexual experience or during an intense sexual experience, they may associate that object or situation with sexual arousal.\n\n2. Imprinting: Some theorists suggest that fetishism could develop through early childhood experiences, where a certain object or situation has made a deep impression.\n\n",
