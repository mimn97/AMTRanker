        "reference": "There are many theories, but I am a diaper fetishist (which is fairly uncommon), and I have spent the better part of my life trying to figure out where in the hell it comes from. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was about five or six, and I remember just waking up one day and my mother was gone. No goodbye, no preparation, just gone, and so I sort of felt like she was \"torn\" from me. I think something in me wanted to return to a time when she was still with us and somehow my five year old brain latched on to diapers as that connection. I was wearing diapers when she still lived with us, so my brain associated diapers with stability, love, and my mother. Many psychologists believe those formative years are incredibly important and the \"mental map\" that you develop in those years is the same map you will use the rest of my life. I never really got to experience that whole nurturing period of my life when I was little, and I guess I never really got over it. My dad was a loving man, but very strict, and would yell, scream, and throw me across the room for such small infractions as not taking out the trash. So I guess a desire to wear diapers is what helped me mentally escape such a rough upbringing and put myself in a place where I was comforted, loved, and cared for.\n\nFor the most part I've been able to keep my diaper wearing discreet, as I am at least cognizant enough of the fact that what I enjoy isn't normal so I don't expose unwilling parties to it. A couple close friends know, and also my wife knows and indulges me from time to time, and for the most part it is a private affair. I am very successful, have a career, a beautiful wife, make lots of money, and am generally happy with how my life is going, so I am at least fortunate in that it doesn't have any tangible negative effect on my life. I wear them maybe once a week or so, sometimes twice a week. However, if I could change one thing in my life, I would definitely wish I didn't have a diaper fetish, but I am a realist and I know that is just not going to happen. I am now 30 and I don't remember a time in my life in which I didn't want to wear diapers, and I've come to accept there probably won't be a time I don't want to either. I've struggled with it my whole life, but I realize now that it is part of my \"core\" of who I am, and having this fetish has made me more accepting of people who do things I don't agree with, less judgmental of other people, and more sensitive to other people's wants and desires. So I guess you could say trying to remove it would remove a core aspect of who I am and would likely change the type of person I have become. Since I'm happy with who I am, I'll just accept it. Telling me to \"just quit\" is as impossible as telling me to not like baseball, or to stop liking video games. Sure you can TELL yourself you don't like those things any more, but you can't really lie to yourself that well and you know how you really feel. So that's how my fetish started.\n\nTL;DR Had a diaper fetish since my earliest memories, came from my mother leaving me at a young age and strict upbringing by my father.\n\nedit: To clarify to those who have never heard of people like me, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with children. Child pornography is a disgusting, despicable practice and the grand majority of people who share my interests feel the same way. \n\nedit 2: I should do an AMA...this is fun!

The exact cause of fetishism is not fully understood, but it is believed to be the result of a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.\n\nBiological factors that may contribute to the development of fetishism include brain structure and function, hormonal imbalances, and genetic predisposition. Psychological factors may include past experiences, trauma, and personality traits such as low self-esteem or a need for control. Social factors",
        "System K": " Sexual fetishism can start in a variety of ways. Some people may be born with a natural inclination towards certain fetishes, while others may develop them as a result of exposure to certain stimuli. For example, some people may develop a fetish for feet as a result of being forced to wear shoes for long periods of time, while others may develop a fetish for bondage as a result of reading erotic novels or watching pornography. Additionally, some people may develop fetishes as a result of traumatic experiences, such as being sexually abused as a child.\n",

        "System B": "Sexual fetishisms can start in a variety of ways, and the exact cause is not fully understood. However, there are a few theories that seek to explain their origin.\nOne common theory is that fetishisms develop during early childhood or adolescence. Some psychologists believe that certain objects, body parts, or situations may become associated with sexual pleasure or arousal through a process known as classical conditioning. This occurs when a person repeatedly experiences sexual pleasure in conjunction with a specific stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus that can elicit sexual arousal on its own.\n\nFor example, if a person associates high heels with sexual pleasure because they were exposed to it during",
        "System E": " Sexual fetishisms can develop in many different ways. One common way for fetishism to begin is via association through repetitive exposure and imaginings. For example, a person might become aroused by an item or experience in the past, such as a certain texture or item of clothing. This could lead to the development of a fetish for that specific item or feeling. Generally, exposure to a certain stimulus repeatedly in a situation that is sexually arousing can eventually lead to the development of a fetish. Additionally, some people may have naturally occurring fetishes, often because of genetic and/or neurological factors.",
        "System F": "Sexual fetishisms can start due to a variety of factors. It is important to note that the topic is still widely researched and there isn't a definitive answer to this question. There are a few theories that psychologists and sexologists propose:\n1. Classical Conditioning: This theory suggests that the fetish develops through association. For example, if an object or situation was present during a person's first sexual experience or during an intense sexual experience, they may associate that object or situation with sexual arousal.\n\n2. Imprinting: Some theorists suggest that fetishism could develop through early childhood experiences, where a certain object or situation has made a deep impression.\n\n",
        "System I": " Sexual fetishisms are developed in early childhood. The brain is developing very quickly during childhood and is very sensitive to environmental influences. Children learn to associate certain objects, situations, or people with sexual pleasure. This can lead to sexual fetishes that persist into adulthood.",

For example, a person may grow up hearing their parents talk about sex or seeing a lot of sexually explicit content in the media. This can create a curiosity about sex in that person, and later in life that curiosity may turn into a sexual fetish.",

For example, growing up in a family with a strong emphasis on traditional gender roles or being exposed to sexually explicit material can increase a person's likelihood of developing a fetish.\n\nPersonal experiences: Personal experiences, such as sexual trauma or past relationships, can also contribute to",
