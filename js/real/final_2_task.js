Economic Decline: Puerto Rico has been in a recession for over a decade, with a shrinking economy and high unemployment rates.

Furthermore, the island\u2019s debt burden is much higher than that of other US states, as a result of previous borrowing by its government and a number of public monopolies.

Other factors include substantial government debts and public pension obligations which Puerto Rico cannot pay due to their economic conditions. Also, the government has provided generous tax incentives to big corporations in an effort to stimulate the economy, but this strategy failed to foster long-term, sustainable economic growth.
