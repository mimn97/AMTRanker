    "instruction": "Why are some people very easily motivated to workout and can self motivate while others have severe difficulty self motivating or continuing good habits?",
    "reference": "I think the nature vs nurture part of the debate is one we probably won't have an answer to for quite some time. Though regardless of its origin, I would say it's definitely a psychological thing.\n\nI would suspect part of the differences would be due each person's level of intrinsic (internal) motivation to go to the gym. If someone is intrinsically motivated to go to the gym, it means they personally enjoy the task, enjoy the benefits, and are driven to go to the gym from a place within themselves, not relying on being motivated by outside sources. There are different types and strengths of intrinsic motivation that could fit along a spectrum, ranging from something like *\"I'm motivated because I SHOULD go to the gym and I know it's healthy for me\"* being on the weaker end of things, to *\"I'm motivated to go to the gym because I enjoy the process, I love the way it makes me feel, I genuinely care for me health and want to keep myself healthy, and love everything about the activity (e.g., dieting, the biological aspect of it, etc)\"*. So depending on where you end up along that spectrum will ultimately affect your motivation to go.\n\nI think this then begs the question, what is ultimately driving your internal motivation to do these things? The driving force here may be to stay healthy and to improve the way you look physically. Going to the gym is a way you can meet these internal goals you have set for yourself. At the same time, you might not enjoy the exercises the gym has to offer, and going to the gym might just not be the right type of exercise for you. In this case, you care about your health and the way you look and you are intrinsically motivated by these things, but the barrier to you reaching these goals would actually be the activity you're choosing to do to meet them. \n\nI think in your own circumstance (while trying to not turn this into an advice thread), picking up on you saying *\"even if they know it is good for them and brings good results\"* makes me think you choose to go to the gym because you think you *should* go. You know it's good for you, but it is not necessarily something you are intrinsically motivated to do on your own accord. The language difference here, compared to a person that says \"I go to the gym because I *want* to go\", I think shows a difference in where your motivation may lie.\n\nAnd often for people and their health it's all about finding the right motivation, and the right activity to do that enables them to meet their own goals. So using myself as an example: I personally am a rock climber. While it is an activity I do so that I keep healthy physically ad mentally, it is an activity I also enjoy for a number of reasons other than purely the health benefits it brings me. So I don't just go because I'm going to get fitter, I go because I absolutely love everything else there is about the sport. The enjoyment of the movement, the physical and mental challenge it brings, and an enjoyment of managing and using the equipment involved is what motivates me. I'm motivated to become a better climber and reach new goals in terms of how hard I can climb. I love the outdoors, which is where rock climbing takes me. What I'm *not* motivated by is to have an overly muscular physique or to get big, as I find it kinda useless other than looking good in a way society says I should, which I don't subscribe to. So rock climbing meets these goals pretty well. I also do yoga occasionally, as I know it's great for me and keeps my mind and body happy, which I feel that I do care about deeply. I love the way I feel during and after yoga, and I can see the benefits it brings to other areas of my life. However, I experience a number of other barriers to doing yoga, such as cost and time commitment, and it comes second to rock climbing which I put all my extra time and energy into.\n\nSo yeah, that's more than I was planning to write about myself. Hopefully you can see the point I was trying to make.\n\nEdit: Where I have motivational issues is with getting my uni work done, which is probably what leads me to writing long replies on motivation in /r/eli5 -_-",
